My project integrates machine learning algorithms with the Django framework to create an efficient email spam detection system. By utilizing labeled email datasets and implementing various machine learning techniques such as natural language processing (NLP) and supervised learning, the system learns to distinguish between legitimate emails and spam. The Django framework facilitates seamless integration, providing a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the system. Through continuous training and refinement, the model improves its accuracy in identifying spam emails, thereby enhancing email security and reducing the risk of phishing attacks. With scalability and reliability at its core, this project contributes to the ongoing efforts to combat email spam and ensure a safer online communication environment.
